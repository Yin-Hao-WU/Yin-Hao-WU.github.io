My name is Yinhao Wu (吴寅昊), I was born in Liaocheng City (聊城市), Shandong Province (山东省), China (中国), which is an ancient city with thousands of years of civilization.

"Wu" is my surname. In Chinese, "Yin" means "tiger", also can mean "third", according to the Chinese lunar calendar, I was born on the third day of the Chinese lunar tiger year. Structurally, the upper part of "Hao" is Chinese "sun" and the lower part is Chinese "sky", which means my parents want me to be an upright person.

Now, I am a PhD candidate in Theoretical Astrophysics Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester. My supervisor is Prof. Sergei Nayakshin. I am committed to exploring the universe with numerical simulation, mainly is Protoplanetary disks (PPDs). My network is very extensive, collaborators/supervisors include Dr. Min-Kai Lin (ASIAA, Taipei) and Prof. Douglas N. C. Lin (UCSC).
